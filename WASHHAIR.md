 Step-by-Step Hair Wash Algorithm

  1 Initialize Wash Day Routine
  
  function preWash() {
    console.log("🛠️ Detangling hair and applying pre-poo treatment...");
}

Use a wide-tooth comb to remove knots and shed hair.
Apply a pre-poo treatment to prevent moisture loss (optional).

2 Hydrate Hair – wetHair() Function

function wetHair() {
    console.log("💦 Saturating hair with lukewarm water...");
}


Completely soak your hair with lukewarm water to prepare for cleansing.
This step opens the hair cuticle for effective shampooing.


 3 Apply Shampoo – cleanseScalp()

function cleanseScalp() {
    console.log("🧴 Applying sulfate-free shampoo...");
}

Apply shampoo to your scalp, not your strands.
Massage gently using fingertips (not nails) to remove buildup.
Rinse thoroughly and repeat if necessary (especially for heavy product buildup).

4 Rinse & Condition – hydrateStrands()

function hydrateStrands() {
    console.log("🫧 Applying conditioner to mid-lengths and ends...");
}

Apply conditioner to your mid-lengths and ends (not the scalp!).
Let it sit for 2-5 minutes for maximum hydration.
Rinse with cool water to close the cuticle and lock in moisture.

5 Optional Deep Conditioning – applyHairMask()

function applyHairMask() {
    console.log("🔬 Running deep conditioning process...");
}

If extra hydration is needed, use a deep conditioner or hair mask.
Let it process for 15-30 minutes before rinsing.

6 Dry & Style – finalizeRoutine()

function finalizeRoutine() {
    console.log("📜 Squeezing excess water, applying leave-in conditioner...");
}

Gently squeeze out excess water using a microfiber towel or T-shirt.
Apply leave-in conditioner or serum to maintain moisture.
Let hair air-dry or use a low heat setting if blow-drying.



Execute the Full Hair Wash Routine

function washHairRoutine() {
    preWash();
    wetHair();
    cleanseScalp();
    hydrateStrands();
    applyHairMask(); // Optional
    finalizeRoutine();
    console.log("🎉 Hair wash complete! Scalp refreshed, hydration locked.");
}

washHairRoutine();
